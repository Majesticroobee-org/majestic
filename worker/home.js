//
// Every band, shelf, heading and tile on the home page used to be written into
// pages.jsx: the order they ran in, the words on them, which three tiles sat
// under the hero, and — the thing the house actually asked for — which products
// a shelf showed. All of it was a deploy.
//
// A block names *where* its products come from rather than naming the products,
// except when the house has picked them by hand. The resolving happens here so
// the storefront is handed a finished list and the admin, the storefront and
// the tests all agree on one set of rules.
//
// The rule worth stating out loud, because it is the one that makes a curated
// shelf safe: **a hand-picked list is a preference, not a promise.** It is
// still filtered by what is actually buyable, and still topped up from the
// house's own catalogue order when it comes up short. "Ready at your store
// today" naming something the store has not got is worse than no shelf at all.
