// The home page as data, exercised directly.
//
// The house asked to choose what shows under "Best sellers" and "Ready at your
// store". Curation is the easy half; the hard half is that a curated shelf goes
// stale in a way a computed one cannot — the moment a hand-picked piece sells
// out, or is taken off the shop floor, the shelf is lying. So:
//
//   · a hand-picked list is honoured in the house's own order
//   · ...but never shows something that cannot be bought
//   · ...and a shelf left short is topped up rather than shown half-empty
//   · a band is *not* topped up, because padding a category window with
//     something from another category makes the copy beside it untrue
//   · a parent category means everything underneath it
//   · switching a block off, or reordering the page, is data and not a deploy
