# Majestic Roobee — Perfume Ecommerce Platform

Full-stack ecommerce platform for Majestic Roobee (extrait perfumes, body mists & feminine care — Abuja · Lagos · Ibadan), built from the Claude Design handoff bundles:

- **Storefront** (`/`) — home (a banner hero, the shelf tiles and a **daily deal** counting down beside them), shop with filters/search, the merchandising shelves (new arrivals, deals, best sellers, gift sets), categories (seven shelves with sub-categories under them, picked from the header rail), brands, stores, a wishlist, the journal (blog), reviews & testimonials, product detail with per-store availability, cart, guest checkout (Paystack / bank transfer / WhatsApp), order confirmation, guest order tracking, about, contact + live-chat concierge, lead-capture popup, live purchase notes, NGN/USD currency toggle, city-based store routing.
- **Admin** (`/admin/`) — passphrase login, dashboard (revenue KPIs, 14-day chart, revenue by location, top products, recent orders with status updates, completed vs abandoned checkouts), inventory per store with steppers & restock, product catalogue with draft/live toggle and "add product", collections, categories & sub-categories, deals, **daily deals** (a scheduled countdown offer whose price is the price charged), the blog, reviews & testimonials, sales & promo codes, notifications/campaign composer with live previews (popup, banner, email, push), customer-service inbox with threads & canned replies, and store/content settings that drive the storefront.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
| --- | --- |
| Hosting & API | **Cloudflare Workers** (one Worker: static assets + JSON API via [Hono](https://hono.dev)) |
| Database | **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) — products, variants, per-store stock, orders + timelines, promos, campaigns, inquiries, leads, abandoned checkouts, settings |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite (two SPA entries: storefront and admin) |
| Payments | Paystack (server-side init + verify + signed webhook), with bank-transfer and WhatsApp fallbacks |

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply majestic-roobee --local   # create + seed local DB
npm run dev:worker                                          # build UI + run worker on :8787
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8787 (storefront) and http://127.0.0.1:8787/admin/ (admin — dev passphrase `majestic-dev`).

For UI iteration with hot reload, run `npm run dev` (Vite on :5173, proxying `/api` to the worker) alongside `npx wrangler dev`.

## Deploying to Cloudflare

The production D1 database (`majestic-roobee`, id in `wrangler.jsonc`) is already provisioned and seeded. Deploys run through GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) on every push to `main`, or manually via *Actions → Deploy to Cloudflare → Run workflow*.

Required repository secrets (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*):

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API token with the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin portal login passphrase |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN_SECRET` | Random string that signs admin session tokens |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Only needed if the token can see multiple accounts |
| `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` | Enables card payment — see below |
| `ERP_API_KEY` / `ERP_API_SECRET` | Enables the ERP pull — see below |
| `META_CAPI_TOKEN` | Lets the server report purchases to Meta (Conversions API), alongside the pixel — Events Manager → your pixel → Settings → Generate access token. The Pixel ID itself goes in Admin → Settings → Analytics |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Sends email (order updates, password resets, alerts) through Resend — see below |
| `RESEND_FROM` | The From address, e.g. `Majestic Roobee <hello@majesticroobee.shop>` — must be on a domain verified in Resend |
| `RESEND_REPLY_TO` | Optional — where customers' replies land |
| `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` | Encrypts the nightly database backup. **Required** — this repository is public, so without it the backup job refuses to run rather than publish the database |
| `OLD_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `OLD_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Only while moving accounts — see below. Delete them afterwards |

The deploy checks the site at the `workers.dev` address wrangler reports for the account it deployed to. To check a custom domain instead, set the repository **variable** (not secret) `SITE_URL`, e.g. `https://majesticroobee.shop`.

To deploy from a machine instead: `wrangler login`, then `npm run deploy` and `wrangler secret put` for the secrets above.

## Moving Cloudflare accounts

Cloudflare can't move a D1 database or an R2 bucket from one account to another,
so the shop moves by copy. *Actions → Migrate from old Cloudflare account*
(`.github/workflows/migrate-account.yml`) exports the old account's database,
lifts the product photos still stored inside it out into the new account's R2
bucket along with the ones already in R2, imports the rest, and checks every
table's row count against the export. Nothing it reads is uploaded or logged —
this repository is public.

1. **New account:** a D1 database named `majestic-roobee` (its id in
   `wrangler.jsonc`) and an R2 bucket named `majesticroobee`. Both exist.
2. **Secrets:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` for the *new*
   account (the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template plus **D1 Edit** and
   **R2 Edit**), and `OLD_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `OLD_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
   for the old one (**D1 Read** and **R2 Read** are enough). Plus every Worker
   secret above — Cloudflare never shows a secret again once set, so they come
   from wherever they were first recorded.
3. **Run the migration.** Tick *Replace what is in the new database* on any
   run after the first, or if a deploy has already run — a deploy applies the
   migrations, which seed the sample catalogue into an empty database. Then
   look the new site over.
4. **Switch over.** Run the migration once more, with *replace* ticked, so
   orders placed in the meantime come across. Then straight away: re-point the
   Paystack webhook at the new address, and in the **old** account
   remove the `majestic-roobee` Worker's cron trigger (Settings → Triggers) or
   delete the Worker. Left running, its 15-minute job keeps pulling from ERPRev
   and sending automation emails from the old database alongside the new site.
5. **Never run the migration after the switch** — it replaces the new
   database with the old account's.

## Moving to majesticroobee.shop

The Worker answers on its `workers.dev` address today (the deploy log prints
it). Once the domain is on the Cloudflare account:

1. **Add the domain to the Worker.** Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages →
   `majestic` → Settings → Domains & Routes → **Add → Custom domain** →
   `majesticroobee.shop` (and again for `www.majesticroobee.shop`). Cloudflare
   creates the DNS records and the certificate. Nothing in the repo changes;
   the workers.dev address keeps working, which the deploy's smoke test uses.
2. **Tell the shop its address.** Admin → Settings → *The shop's web address* →
   `https://majesticroobee.shop`. Abandoned-cart links, the email letterhead's
   logo and links, and the sitemap read it.
3. **Re-point the Paystack webhook** at the new address
   (`/api/paystack/webhook`). Admin → Integrations shows the URL to copy.
4. **Email.** Verify `majesticroobee.shop` in resend.com → Domains (add the DNS
   records it lists, in Cloudflare) and set `RESEND_FROM` to an address on it,
   e.g. `Majestic Roobee <hello@majesticroobee.shop>`.

## Paystack

The integration uses Paystack's **redirect** flow, so there is only ever one
credential to hold: the **secret key**. No public key is needed, and none is
shipped to the browser.

### Where the key goes

| Environment | Where | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Production** | GitHub → *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions* | Add `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`. The deploy workflow pushes it to the Worker on the next run. |
| **Production, without a deploy** | Cloudflare | `npx wrangler secret put PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` |
| **Local** | `.dev.vars` (gitignored) | `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_…` |

Use the **test** key (`sk_test_…`) from *Paystack Dashboard → Settings → API Keys
& Webhooks* until you have made a full test purchase. Swap in the live key
(`sk_live_…`) only when you want real cards charged.

### The webhook

Point Paystack at:

```
https://<your-domain>/api/paystack/webhook
```

Set it in the same dashboard panel as the keys. This is the leg that arrives
even when the shopper closes the tab on their bank's 3-D Secure page, so
payment still settles. It is signature-verified; unsigned requests are refused.

### Checking it worked

*Admin → Integrations* shows a **Payments** panel: whether a key is present,
whether it is a test or live key, the webhook URL to copy, and a log of every
exchange with Paystack — including charges that were **refused** for the wrong
amount. If the panel says "Not connected", the card option is hidden at
checkout entirely rather than failing at the last step.

### What the server guarantees

- An order is marked paid only when Paystack confirms a successful charge for
  the **exact amount and currency** this server initialized. A charge for a
  different amount is logged as a mismatch and settles nothing.
- The redirect leg and the webhook race by design; settlement is idempotent, so
  whichever arrives second changes nothing and does not re-send the
  post-purchase email.
- An unpaid card order holds its stock for 45 minutes, then the cron releases it
  — after re-checking with Paystack, so an order paid at the last second is
  rescued rather than cancelled.
- Card orders require a valid email address, because that is what a Paystack
  transaction is keyed to.

### Test cards

Paystack's test cards work with a `sk_test_` key — see
<https://paystack.com/docs/payments/test-payments/>. The standard success card
is `4084 0840 8408 4081`, any future expiry, any CVV, OTP `123456`.

## How the ecommerce logic works

- **Variable products** — a product is a parent; each variation (a size, a scent) is a SKU-level record with its own price, photo, per-store stock, sort order and active flag. The storefront shows one listing card with a picker on it — swatch chips, falling back to a dropdown past four options — and the price, availability badge, photo and add-to-cart button all follow the selection. A product can opt into `split_listing` to appear as one card *per* variation instead, for gift sets and distinct scents where a picker would hide the choice. Each variation has its own URL (`/product/<id>?variant=<sku>`), its own canonical tag and its own entry in the page's JSON-LD `AggregateOffer`, so a shared link resolves to the size the shopper was looking at.
- **Variation identity** — carts, order lines and waitlist entries address a variation by its id, not by its size text, so renaming a size never orphans a cart or breaks a back-in-stock alert. Carts saved by an older build (which keyed on size) still resolve through a fallback.
- **Store routing** — an order is fulfilled from the shopper's city store when it holds every item; otherwise it routes to the nearest store holding the full order (cross-city ETA/fee applies). Stock is reserved (decremented) at the fulfilling store when the order is placed.
- **Pricing** — totals are always recomputed server-side: subtotal, promo discount (scoped: storewide / fragrances / gift packages / feminine care; % off, ₦ off, or free delivery), delivery fee by store (free Abuja delivery above the configured threshold), click-&-collect is free.
- **Payment states** — orders are created `pending` and only marked `paid` after server-side Paystack verification (redirect verify + signed webhook) or manual confirmation.
- **Tracking** — guests track with order number + the phone/email used at checkout; timelines update as the admin moves order status.
- **Ratings** — the stars on every product come only from buyers (`worker/reviews.js`). Three days after an order is marked *Delivered* or *Collected* (or ten days after payment, for an order nobody marks), the cron emails the buyer once with five tappable stars beside each item; a tap opens `/review/<token>` with that rating chosen. The token is the permission, so no sign-in is needed and nobody can rate what they didn't buy. Reviews publish straight away (*Admin → Ratings* can hide, answer, or hold written reviews for approval) and feed the card stars, the product page's Customer Reviews, the `AggregateRating` search sees, and the **Top Rated** shelf — which is ordered by a Bayesian average and never padded. The email needs a provider (Resend) and the shop's web address in Settings; until then it waits in the outbox like every other automation.
- **Admin ↔ storefront sync** — settings, store details, promos, stock, drafts, and banner campaigns all live in D1, so admin edits are immediately visible to shoppers.

## The storefront on a phone

Under 860px wide the storefront switches to a shopping-first layout, built from the "Majestic Roobee Mobile" design (`src/storefront/mobile-*.jsx`):

- **Chrome** — a slim header (menu or back arrow, logo, search, account), a row of chips for the delivery city, the currency and the Perfume Studio, and a **tab bar** under the thumb: Home, Shop, Deals, Saved, Cart.
- **Sheets instead of hover menus** — the menu drawer, full-screen search (recent searches and live results), city & currency, "choose a size" for multi-size cards, "added to your cart", filters and sort, and a chat sheet (WhatsApp, call, message us here, book, track).
- **Pages** — the home page draws the same home blocks as a desktop, as sideways rails; `/shop/categories` is the category index; the listing is a two-column grid with a sticky Filter / Sort bar; the product page has a swipe gallery and a pinned "Add to cart"; `/cart` is a page with the promo box and free-delivery bar; checkout is three numbered sections with the pay button pinned to the bottom.

Everything is drawn from the same data and rules as the desktop — `ctx.card()` for prices and availability, `useShopList()` (`src/storefront/shop-list.js`) for what the grid contains, and the server for delivery and payment — so the two layouts can't disagree. Desktop is unchanged.

## The storefront's shelves

The header carries the shelves a fragrance shopper expects — **All categories**,
New arrivals, Deals, Best sellers, Brands, Locations, Journal, Reviews — and each
is a real, linkable, indexable URL rather than a filter the browser holds:
`/new-arrivals`, `/deals`, `/best-sellers`, `/gift-sets`, `/brand/<name>`,
`/shop?category=<id>`, and any of those combined (`/deals?category=mist`).

Three of the four shelves are **computed, not curated** (`worker/merch.js`), so
nobody has to keep a list up to date:

| Shelf | What it reads | Admin's hand on it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New arrivals | Products listed inside the last *n* days (Settings, default 45), newest first | "Pin to New arrivals" on the product |
| Best sellers | Units sold on **paid, uncancelled** orders over the last *n* days (Settings, default 90) | "Pin to Best sellers" on the product |
| Gift sets | Every category grouped as **Gift & sets** in Admin → Categories | The grouping itself |
| Deals | A deal that is inside its window, plus anything priced below its own compare-at price | Admin → Deals |

A shelf that would otherwise come back nearly empty is topped up in the shop's
own catalogue order — an empty tab reads as a broken store. The two shelves
where emptiness is honest (no sets, nothing marked down) stay empty.

**Categories are content**, not seed data: Admin → Categories adds, renames,
describes, groups, reorders and hides them, and each one chooses which of the
three sub-shelves it offers shoppers. The header's mega-menu is built from that
table, so a new category appears in it without a deploy. A category with
products filed under it is refused deletion (with the count) rather than
cascading — move them, or hide it.

**Deals vs promo codes** — a promo code is something the shopper *types*; a deal
is something they *see*. A deal names its products, carries a badge and runs
between two dates, so it leaves the storefront by itself when the window closes.

## Reward codes

A **promo** is a public sale: one code, printed on a flyer, used by everybody.
A **reward** is the opposite — **one code, one person, one use** — so it lives
in its own table (`reward_codes`) with its own engine (`worker/rewards.js`).
Checkout has one code box; the server reads the promos table first and rewards
second, and `mintCode` never issues a reward that collides with a sale code.

A reward can be worth more than a promo can: as well as `pct`, `amt` and `ship`,
it can be `item` — **one product free**. That is not a zero-priced line on the
order: the shopper puts the product in their cart and the reward takes its unit
price off as a discount, so stock, packing and the order total all behave
normally. A free-product reward either names a size (and is refused, by name,
if that size isn't in the cart) or names none, in which case it takes the
cheapest thing its scope covers.

**How a code comes to exist**

| Route | When | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Earned | An order is **paid for** — a Paystack settlement or a transfer a manager confirms | `markPaid()` → `issueEarnedReward()` |
| Issued | A giveaway, an apology, an influencer — one code or up to 200 at a time | Admin → Rewards |

Earning runs off settings, not code, so the rule changes without a deploy:
`rewardsOn`, `rewardEarnKind`, `rewardEarnValue`, `rewardEarnMinSpend`,
`rewardEarnScope`, `rewardEarnExpiryDays`, `rewardCodePrefix`. It is issued at
**payment**, not at checkout, because an order that was placed and never paid
for has earned nothing — and it is idempotent on the order number, because
`markPaid` is deliberately racy (the redirect leg and the webhook both call it).

**The three rules, and what enforces them**

- *One code* — `mintCode` draws from an alphabet with no `O/0`, `I/1` or `S/5`,
  and checks both tables before returning.
- *One person* — `owner_key` is the normalised contact it was issued to, checked
  against the contact on the order. A code with no owner is a bearer code, which
  is what a giveaway wants. The check is soft at validate time (the shopper may
  not have typed their email yet) and hard when the order is placed.
- *One use* — the code is claimed with a **conditional UPDATE before the order is
  written**, so two checkouts racing on one code are settled by the database
  rather than by whichever request commits last. If the order write then fails,
  the claim is released — scoped to that order number, so a code another
  checkout has legitimately taken is never resurrected. (This is why
  `redeemed_order_no` is deliberately not a foreign key: the claim happens in
  the instant before the order it names exists.)

**Endpoints**

```
POST /api/promos/validate      { code, items, contact? }  → promo or reward, with its worth
POST /api/orders               { ..., promo: "<code>" }    → resolves either, redeems a reward
GET  /api/orders/track         → the reward that order earned, once it is paid
GET  /api/account/me           → the signed-in customer's own codes
GET  /api/admin/rewards        → the ledger, the totals and the earning rule
POST /api/admin/rewards        → mint (super admin)
POST /api/admin/rewards/:code/void | /restore
GET  /api/v1/rewards           → read-only, for a CRM or loyalty dashboard
```

## Wishlist, the About page, the blog, reviews and purchase notes

- **Wishlist** — guest-first. Saving something never demands an account: the
  list lives in the shopper's browser and is handed to the server the moment
  they sign in or register (`POST /api/account/wishlist/merge`), so nothing is
  lost at the point of registration. Signed in, it is the same list everywhere.
- **The About page** (`/about`) — the heading, what the house says about
  itself, the founder's story, her name and title, the band at the foot and
  the page's own search title and description are all **Admin → Settings →
  About page**, written in the journal's plain-text format (a blank line
  between paragraphs, `## ` for a heading). Every field falls back to the
  copy the store shipped with, so an emptied box restores those words rather
  than publishing a blank page, and the home page's story band reads the same
  story — one story, two places, never out of step.
- **The blog** (`/blog`) — written in Admin → Blog as plain text: a blank
  line between paragraphs, `## ` for a heading, `> ` for a pull quote, and a
  bare image URL on its own line for a picture. Drafts are invisible until
  published; the publish date is stamped once, so editing a live post doesn't
  reorder the blog. Posts carry `BlogPosting` markup and appear in the
  sitemap. Two boxes are capped, because both decide how the blog *looks*
  rather than what it says: the **heading** (70 characters, with a word count
  beside it, so a card doesn't wrap to four lines) and the **preview** (220
  characters — two or three sentences, which is all a reader sees before they
  open the story). The limit is enforced in the editor, again in the API, and
  again on the way out, so a post written before any of it existed still shows
  short. An empty preview falls back to the story's first *paragraph*, skipping
  a heading, a quote or a photograph.
- **Book a consultation** (`/consultation`) — the Perfume Studio's page, with
  Calendly's calendar framed on it so the booking is completed without leaving
  the site. No Calendly script is loaded; only `frame-src` names calendly.com,
  and only calendly.com is accepted. Every word is in Admin → Settings → The
  Perfume Studio, and the switch there also controls the floating button, the
  footer link and whether the page is in the sitemap at all. With bookings on
  but no Calendly link yet, the page asks people to call or message instead of
  showing an empty frame.
- **Reviews & testimonials** (`/reviews`) — the customer's own post. Paste an
  Instagram post or reel, a TikTok, a YouTube video or a direct video file and
  the server reduces it to the post's id, so a copied link with tracking on it
  still renders and the platform never has to be picked from a menu. Each is
  framed through that platform's **own** `/embed` URL: no third-party script
  runs on the store. A link we don't recognise becomes a written quote card
  rather than a broken frame. (`public/_headers` names exactly those four frame
  origins in the CSP.)
- **Live purchase notes** — "Dorothy from Abuja purchased Osk 30ml", from real
  orders. Two rules make that safe on a public endpoint: only ever a **first
  name** and a city, and only orders that were actually **paid for** — an
  abandoned card attempt is not a purchase. The window, the interval and the
  off-switch are in Settings; a shopper who dismisses it doesn't see it again
  that visit.

## Email (Resend)

Every email the shop sends goes through `worker/email.js`: order paid and
status updates, back-in-stock alerts, abandoned-cart reminders, the welcome
email, password resets and the low-stock digest to the house. Each is written
as plain text in **Admin → Integrations → Automations** and sent in the shop's
letterhead (HTML plus a plain-text part); a paragraph that is a label and a
single link — "Pick up where you left off: https://…" — becomes a button.

| Secret | What |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | resend.com → **API Keys** → create one with *Sending access* (restrict it to your domain) |
| `RESEND_FROM` | `Majestic Roobee <hello@majesticroobee.shop>` — the domain must be verified in resend.com → **Domains** (they give you the DNS records to add) |
| `RESEND_REPLY_TO` | Optional — where customers' replies land, e.g. the customer-service inbox |

Add them as GitHub Actions secrets and the next deploy pushes them to the
Worker. Then **Admin → Integrations → Email (Resend) → Send test** proves it
end to end. A refusal shows Resend's own reason ("domain is not verified"),
not a bare status code; a rate limit or outage is retried once on the next
cron; and every send carries an idempotency key, so a retry never lands twice.
Without a key nothing is lost — messages are recorded as `queued`, readable in
the same log.

## Connecting the ERP

The house runs **ERPRevolution (ERPrev)**, and the connector is set up from
ERPRev's own API reference — [their developer guide](https://erprev.com/user-guide/developers/).
Nothing is welded to it: which ERP it talks to is a setting, everything
vendor-shaped is one file (`worker/erp-adapters.js`) behind four neutral row
shapes, and the sync engine (`worker/erp.js`) knows about none of it.

**The link is a pull, and only a pull.** The Worker calls ERPRev's API on a
schedule (hourly by default; the 15-minute cron decides whose turn it is),
reads products, stock, warehouses and categories, and writes per-shop stock
into the shop. Nothing has to be built inside the ERP, and it works even if
ERPRev can only be reached *outward*. The API key is all it needs.

ERPRev only sends outgoing webhooks on its Ultimate plan, which the house is
not on, so there is no inbound ERP address: an earlier `/api/erp/webhook`
receiver never got a delivery and was removed (migration `0029`). A stock
change in ERPRev reaches the shop on the next pull, within the hour.

**What the pull reads, and what it leaves alone.** ERPRev's product rows carry
no price, so the shop keeps the prices set in the admin. Stock is set
absolutely per mapped shop, on hand less reserved. A stock row with no
quantity the reader recognises changes nothing — it is counted as unread, and
the sync log says `STOCK UNREADABLE` with the keys ERPRev sent, rather than
reading the missing figure as 0. Every run's log line gives how many stock
rows were read and the units on the matched sizes.

**Where the stock goes.** Into **Abuja** by default (Admin → Integrations →
step 5 changes it). The default applies only where it cannot be wrong: a stock
row naming no location, or an ERP that has only ever shown one location — and
that location is then written into the map, so it stays Abuja's when a second
one appears. With two or more ERP locations, each has to be mapped (or use
**Map every location to Abuja** if all of it really is Abuja's stock).

The older **`POST /api/v1/catalog/sync`** (below) is still there for anything
that would rather send the whole feed.

### What ERPRev's API is

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Base URL** | `https://<your-system's-address>/api/v2` — ERPRev is multi-tenant on a subdomain |
| **Auth** | **Signed requests** — four headers on every call: `X-Api-Key` (the key id), `X-Api-Timestamp` (Unix seconds), `X-Api-Nonce` (32 hex, never reused), `X-Api-Signature` (`v1=` + hex HMAC-SHA256). **The secret never travels.** |
| **Canonical string** | Five lines joined by `\n`: the method upper-cased · the path (with `/api/v2`) plus `?` and the query's `key=value` pairs **sorted** · the timestamp · the nonce · the hex SHA-256 of the raw body (`e3b0c442…b855` for a GET). Implemented in `signRequest` (`worker/erp-adapters.js`) and tested byte-for-byte against ERPRev's own Node reference client |
| **Clock** | The signing timestamp must be within **±300 seconds** of the ERP's. Outside that, `auth.clock_skew` |
| **Paging** | Cursor, not page numbers: `limit` (1–200, default 50) and `cursor` |
| **Envelope** | `{ "data": [ … ], "page": { limit, count, has_more, next_cursor } }` |
| **Two gates** | Every route needs a **scope** *and* the key's attached user needs the matching **module privilege**. `auth.insufficient_scope` and `auth.insufficient_privilege` say which one refused |
| **Endpoints used** | `GET /products` · `GET /stocks` · `GET /warehouses` · `GET /product-categories` |
| **Scopes needed** | `products.read` · `stocks.read` · `warehouses.read` — read only; the pull never writes |
| **Free checks** | `GET /api/v2/ping` needs no key at all, and the live OpenAPI 3 document at `/api/v2/docs` is public |

### Turning the pull on

Everything is in **Admin → Integrations → Inventory & catalogue link**, as a
checklist in the order it has to be done.

| # | Step | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Which ERP.** ERPrev by default; ERPNext and a blank "type the endpoints in" option are there too. | Admin |
| 2 | **The credentials.** See *What you have to do in ERPRev* below. Then `wrangler secret put ERP_API_KEY` and `wrangler secret put ERP_API_SECRET`, or add them as GitHub Actions secrets and let the deploy push them. They never go in the database and never reach a browser. | Worker secrets |
| 3 | **The base URL**, then **Test the connection** — which calls the unauthenticated `/ping` first, so "we can't reach your ERP" and "your ERP won't accept this key" come back as two different answers rather than one 401. It also reports the clock difference, because past 300 seconds every signed call is refused however right the key is. **Read the API's own spec** asks ERPRev for its published OpenAPI document and prints the security scheme and endpoint paths it declares. | Admin |
| 4 | **Field names**, only if step 3 shows something came back empty. **Show me a row** prints ERPRev's own keys beside the ones the reader matched. | Admin |
| 5 | **The location map.** *Fetch locations* lists them from `/warehouses` (a pull does it too). A single location goes to Abuja automatically; with several, assign each to a shop — one with no shop against it is **not counted**. | Admin |
| 6 | **The category map** (optional). Unmapped categories fall to the default and are reported. | Admin |

### What you have to do in ERPRev

1. **Tick the master switch.** *Allow use of API* on the **General** tab of
   general company preferences. An administrator has to do this before any key
   works at all.
2. **Create a dedicated service user.** ERPRev's own form warns that a key's
   attached user *cannot sign in interactively*, so never attach one to a real
   person's account and certainly not to an MD-level one. Give it read on
   products, stock and warehouses and nothing else — the second gate is the
   user's module privileges, not the key's scopes.
3. **Issue the key.** *Administration › General Configuration › Manage API
   Access* → **Add Access API Token**, attached to that service user. The
   **Authentication Key** and **Authentication Secret** are generated for you,
   and the secret is **shown once** — copy it there and then.
4. **Check it is a v2 key.** If a call returns `401 auth.invalid` saying *"not
   a v2 key"*, it was issued on an older build; re-issue it from Manage API
   Access. This is *not* the same thing as the **API keys** screen under Query
   Studio, which issues a different, read-only, HTTP-Basic key for feeding
   Power BI or Excel.
5. **Watch it.** *View API Token Usage Log* shows which keys were used, when,
   from where, with request and response detail. Manage API Access disables a
   compromised key in one click.

### What the pull does when it runs

It runs on its own — the cron calls it every 15 minutes and it pulls every
*n* minutes (60 by default; Admin → Integrations → step 8). **Recent pulls** on
the same screen is the log of every run.

1. **Reads** products, stock and locations from ERPRev, walking the cursor to
   the end of each list.
2. **Places the stock.** On hand less reserved, per location, into the shop
   the location is mapped to. A single ERPRev location goes to **Abuja**
   automatically and is written into the map; with several, each has to be
   mapped (or **Map every location to Abuja**). Stock in an unmapped location
   is counted nowhere and named in the report.
3. **Recognises what the shop already sells** — the shop was stocked by hand
   before the ERP was connected, with its own SKUs, photos and copy. In order:
   an existing link; an ERPRev barcode/SKU equal to the shop's SKU; the ERPRev
   name (or name + unit) equal to the shop's product name + size, ignoring
   case, spaces and punctuation. Two items reaching for one size, or a name
   the shop sells in several sizes with nothing saying which, is **ambiguous**
   and not linked — a wrong link moves the wrong bottle's stock.
4. **Writes price and stock onto those sizes and nothing else.** The shop's
   SKU, size label, photographs, copy, compare-at price and on/off switch are
   never touched. Other cities' stock is never touched.
5. **Leaves out** ERPRev items the shop doesn't sell (packaging, raw
   materials, retired lines) unless **Bring in ERP items the shop doesn't sell
   yet** is on — then they arrive as drafts, 40 a run.
6. **Refuses** any pull that would cut the stock it looks after, in the shops
   it feeds, by more than the guard (25%) — the expired-key-returns-nothing
   failure. Nothing is written and the refusal is in the log.

**Dry run** shows all of it — every match (ERP item → shop size, price, stock),
what is ambiguous, what is left out, and which shop sizes have no ERPRev item —
without writing anything. Run it once after the first deploy and read it.

### What the reader copes with on its own

- **Authentication** — ERPRev's signed requests, exactly as documented; for other ERPs the token on its own,
  Bearer, two headers, a token pair, HTTP Basic, or credentials in the query
  string.
- **Paging** — cursor, `?page=&per_page=`, `?limit=&offset=`, Frappe's, or none.
- **Envelopes** — `{data:[…]}`, `{results:[…]}`, `{items:[…]}`, a bare array,
  Laravel's paginated `{data:{data:[…]}}`, or a key you name.
- **Field names** — every common spelling, in any case or separator style
  (`ID`, `id`, `ProductID`, `product_id` are one name — ERPRev's live API
  answers in PascalCase), with a per-field override. HTML entities in text
  (`&amp;`, `&#x20A6;`) are decoded. Stock
  rows have their own list, because a stock row's `id` is the stock record's,
  not the product's, and joining on it would attach every quantity to the
  wrong product with nothing anywhere reporting an error.
- **Prices formatted for humans** — `"₦35,000.00"` parses.
- **`disabled` or `active`, either way round**, including `status: "Active"`.
- **Prices and stock on the product row**, which is ERPRev's own shape.

### What the pull does, and what it will not do

- **The ERP owns price and stock. The shop owns everything else.** Names,
  descriptions, photographs, categories and shelf order are only ever written
  for an item the shop has never seen; after that the pull leaves them alone.
- **Stock is on-hand less reserved.**
- **An item the ERP has never stocked sends no stock at all** — not the same
  as sending zero, because the ingest sets counts absolutely.
- **The empty-feed guard.** Any pull that would cut more than the configured
  share (25% by default) off the stock *this connector manages* is refused and
  logged. The denominator matters: measured against the whole shop instead, an
  ERP managing a corner of the catalogue could zero that entire corner and the
  drop would round to nothing.
- **Sizes can be grouped.** ERPRev keeps one row per sellable thing, so three
  sizes of a fragrance arrive as three products — three cards in the shop.
  Optionally (off by default), a product whose name *ends with its own unit*
  has that unit taken off, and rows that then match become one listing with a
  size picker. It never merges on a near-match.
- **New items arrive as drafts** unless the house switches that off.
- **Idempotent.** A re-run updates in place; it never duplicates.
- **Nothing is written back yet.** ERPRev's write endpoints exist
  (`POST /products`, `POST /products/with-stock`, and the sales side), and
  which document an order should become is a question about the house's
  accounting rather than about software.

### Pushing a feed instead

The ERP is the system of record for what exists and what it costs. It pushes a flat list of SKU rows to `POST /api/v1/catalog/sync`, authenticated with an API key issued in *Admin → Integrations* with the **write** scope. Each row carries the parent/style code that groups it with its siblings, which is what turns the feed into variable products here.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-domain>/api/v1/catalog/sync \
  -H "authorization: Bearer <write-scoped key>" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": "acme-erp",
    "dryRun": true,
    "items": [
      { "parentId": "STY-100", "parentName": "Velvet Reign", "category": "extrait",
        "externalId": "SKU-100-30", "sku": "VR-30", "size": "30ml", "priceNgn": 28000,
        "imageUrl": "https://…/vr-30.jpg", "stock": { "abuja": 12, "lagos": 3, "ibadan": 0 } },
      { "parentId": "STY-100", "externalId": "SKU-100-50", "sku": "VR-50",
        "size": "50ml", "priceNgn": 46000, "compareAtNgn": 52000 }
    ]
  }'
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `parentId` | **Required.** The ERP's parent/style code. Rows sharing one become variations of a single product. A row without it is skipped and reported. |
| `externalId` | **Required.** The ERP's own id for this SKU. Upserts key on it. |
| `size` / `option1`–`option3` | The variation's label. Multiple options join as "50ml / Gold". |
| `priceNgn`, `compareAtNgn` | Price and optional was-price, in naira. |
| `sku`, `imageUrl`, `sort`, `active` | The variation's own code, photo, position and on/off. |
| `stock` | `{ abuja, lagos, ibadan }`. Set absolutely, not as a delta. Omitted stores are left alone. |
| `parentName`, `category`, `gender`, `notes`, `description`, `optionNames` | Parent-level fields, read from the first row of each group. Absent fields never overwrite merchandising done in the admin. |

Behaviour worth knowing:

- **Idempotent.** Upserts key on `(source, parentId)` and `(source, externalId)`, so re-sending the same feed updates in place rather than duplicating. A failed sync can simply be retried.
- **Adopts, doesn't shadow.** A parent the ERP has never sent but whose slug already exists is attached to the product already in the catalogue, so the first sync lands on the live catalogue instead of shadowing it.
- **Drafts by default.** New products arrive hidden from the storefront unless the feed passes `"publish": true`, so a mis-mapped import can't dump straight onto the shop.
- **`dryRun`.** Returns the same counts and errors without writing anything — run it first when wiring up a new feed.
- **Audit.** Every run is recorded; read the last 20 at `GET /api/v1/catalog/syncs`.
